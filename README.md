# PolitCtrl

## Controlling the politicians' posts

This project is created to control what words the politicians delete.
When a politician, that is followed by this script, writes a tweet, it gets saved on a database. When they realise what they just done and delete their tweets, it's too late. **Their words won't be forgotten, forever.**
